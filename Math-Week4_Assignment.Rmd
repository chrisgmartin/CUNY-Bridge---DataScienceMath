**Question 2**
Describe the solutions for the following family of equations:

* 'x + 2y - 3z = 5'
* '2x + y - 3z = 13'
* '-x + y = -8'

Not sure if this is correct, since there is an error in the solve function but it could be due to *z* being infinite. Error in solve.default(C) : 
  Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[3,3] = 0

```
C <- matrix(c(1,2,-1,2,1,1,-3,-3,0),3,3)
D <- matrix(c(5,13,-8),3,1)
C
D
solve(C)%*%D
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
C <- matrix(c(1,2,-1,2,1,1,-3,-3,0),3,3)
D <- matrix(c(5,13,-8),3,1)
C
D
```


**Question 4**
Solve for AB
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(4,-3,0,-3,5,1),3,2)
B <- matrix(c(1,3,4,-2),2,2)
A %*% B
```
